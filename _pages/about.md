Welcome to my academic website. I am Zhi-Yi Chin from Taiwan, and I am currently a graduate student in the Institute of Computer Science and Engineering at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University supervised by Prof. <a href="https://walonchiu.github.io" target="_blank">Wei-Chen(Walon)Chiu</a>. Before joining NYCU, I got my bachelor degree from National Chung Cheng University supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~ckchiang/" target="_blank">Chen-Kuo(Adrian)Chiang</a>.
