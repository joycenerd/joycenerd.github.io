Welcome to my academic website. I am Zhi-Yi Chin from Taiwan, and I am currently a graduate student in the Institute of Computer Science and Engineering at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University supervised by Prof. <a href="https://walonchiu.github.io" target="_blank">Wei-Chen(Walon)Chiu</a>

Before joining NYCU, I got my bachelor degree from National Chung Cheng University. In my 3.5 years in CCU, I was diligent in my studies, as seen by my academic achievements, such as making the Dean's list 5 times, and winning the Best Word Award for my research related to vehicle tracking in my final year at CCU.

As you can see, I am passionate and put a lot of effort in everything I do. Recently, I participated in NVIDIA's AI City Challenge Track3 City-Scale Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking and published a CVPR Workshop paper related to it.

Specifically, I hope to do research in the next few years by demonstrating reinforcement learning to solve computer vision problems.
