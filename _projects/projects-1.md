Webapp done my Google CodeU 2019.<br/>
<img src="/images/cal_helper.png">

This is a work done in the Google CodeU program. It took a total of 12 weeks from idea, design to implementation with two other people who were also in this program and an engineer from Google. Calendar Helper is a Webapp and is inspired by me. It is a multifunctional platform for to-do lists and calendars. Its highlight is that we have added a tagging system to calendar events/tasks. Tags categorize your events and tasks. Another important function of the calendar is our dashboard design. Our dashboard is great for visualizing all tasks. All tasks will be organized by tabs on the dashboard so that no important events will be missed. Another feature of our system is that all new tasks or events on our platform will be synchronized to Google Calendar. The front end is written in javascript and the back end is written in Java. From August 1st, 2019 to August 3rd, 2019, we also went to Googleâ€™s headquarters in Singapore to demonstrate results and communicate with other members.
