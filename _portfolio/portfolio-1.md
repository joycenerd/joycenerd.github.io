Google contacted me in March 2019 that there is an amazing program they are going to launch and ask if I'm interested. I immediately replied to the the email that I want to join. From April to July 2019 I was group up with 2 other members and one mentor (softway engineer in Google) to complete a project which is a Webapp. I have learned so much in this program, this is the first time I get in touch in the application side of CS.
